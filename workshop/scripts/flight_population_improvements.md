# Flight Population Script Improvements

## Overview
Updated the flight population scripts to properly implement the comprehensive flight rules from `docs/flight_rules.md`.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Distance-Based Aircraft Selection
- **Before**: Simple capacity-based selection with rough distance estimates
- **After**: Proper distance calculation and aircraft matching per flight rules:
  - 0-800km: Regional jets (CRJ, ERJ) and turboprops (ATR, Dash 8)
  - 800-2,500km: Narrow-body aircraft (A320 family, B737 series)
  - 2,500-5,500km: Large narrow-body (A321, B737-900) or small wide-body
  - 5,500-8,000km: Wide-body aircraft (A330, B777, B787)
  - 8,000+km: Ultra-long-range wide-body (A350-900ULR, B777-200LR)

### 2. Tier-Based Flight Frequency
- **Before**: Simple tier-based daily flight ranges
- **After**: Distance-specific frequency rules per airport tier:
  - **Tier 1 (500+ routes)**: 8-15 short-haul, 4-8 medium-haul, 1-3 long-haul daily
  - **Tier 2 (200-499 routes)**: 4-8 short-haul, 2-4 medium-haul, 3-7 long-haul weekly
  - **Tier 3 (50-199 routes)**: 2-4 short-haul, 1-2 medium-haul, 3-5 long-haul weekly
  - **Tier 4 (10-49 routes)**: 3-7 short-haul weekly, 2-4 medium-haul weekly
  - **Tier 5 (<10 routes)**: 1-3 short-haul weekly only

### 3. Enhanced Distance Estimation
- **Before**: Simple regional code-based estimation
- **After**: Continental pattern-based distance calculation:
  - Same country/region: 200-1,200km
  - Same continent: 800-3,000km
  - Intercontinental: 3,000-12,000km with specific continent-pair ranges

### 4. Improved Flight Duration Calculation
- **Before**: Fixed speed assumptions
- **After**: Distance-category specific speeds and overhead:
  - Short-haul (â‰¤1,500km): 600 km/h + 30min overhead
  - Medium-haul (1,500-4,000km): 700 km/h + 45min overhead
  - Long-haul (>4,000km): 800 km/h + 60min overhead

### 5. Route Prioritization
- **Before**: Basic tier-based multipliers
- **After**: Route efficiency scoring with tier priority:
  - Tier 1 destinations: 1.2x priority boost
  - Tier 2 destinations: 1.1x priority boost
  - Tier 4-5 destinations: 0.8x priority reduction

### 6. Enhanced Aircraft Selection Logic
- **Before**: Simple capacity matching
- **After**: Multi-factor aircraft selection:
  - Distance-appropriate aircraft category
  - Passenger demand estimation based on route tier
  - Frequency-based capacity adjustment (more flights = smaller aircraft)
  - Capacity scoring to prefer optimal aircraft size

### 7. Better Error Handling and Progress Tracking
- **Before**: Basic error handling
- **After**: Comprehensive error handling:
  - Route-specific error logging
  - Graceful handling of missing data
  - Progress tracking with percentage completion
  - Keyboard interrupt handling
  - Database rollback on errors

### 8. Flight Number Generation
- **Before**: Simple route-based numbering
- **After**: Enhanced flight number logic:
  - Date-based variation for consistency
  - Multiple daily flight suffixes (A, B, C...)
  - Airline code truncation for 8-character limit
  - Emergency fallback numbering

## Configuration Updates

### Updated Airport Tiers
- Added distance-specific frequency ranges
- Separate daily/weekly frequency specifications
- Enhanced seasonal boost factors

### New Aircraft Distance Rules
- Six aircraft categories based on distance ranges
- Specific capacity ranges per category
- Aircraft type recommendations per category

## Usage

The improved script maintains the same interface but provides much more realistic flight generation:

```bash
python scripts/populate_flights_comprehensive.py
```

## Benefits

1. **Realistic Flight Patterns**: Flights now follow actual airline operational patterns
2. **Proper Aircraft Utilization**: Aircraft are matched to routes based on distance and demand
3. **Accurate Frequency Distribution**: Flight frequencies match real-world airport tier patterns
4. **Better Performance**: Enhanced error handling and progress tracking
5. **Compliance with Flight Rules**: Full implementation of the comprehensive flight rules

## Next Steps

1. Test the updated script with a small date range
2. Validate generated flight patterns against real-world data
3. Consider adding seasonal route variations
4. Implement hub-and-spoke connectivity patterns
5. Add aircraft maintenance scheduling considerations
