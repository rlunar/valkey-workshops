# Module 3: Anything that can be queried can be cached

## Overview

This module demonstrates that caching isn't limited to database queries - any queryable data source can benefit from caching, including external APIs and AI model responses.

## Learning Objectives

- Cache external API responses
- Implement semantic caching for GenAI
- Reduce latency and costs through strategic caching
- Use Valkey Vector Similarity Search
